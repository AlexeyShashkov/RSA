-- This is the static report of analysis done for the signals crossing power domains.
-- This includes the structural correctness of isolation/level shifter cells and  
-- validity of power domain crossings in absence of these cells.
--
-- This report is structured into two sections
-- a) Domain-wise reporting
--     This section contains information about different isolation/level
--     shifter cells present between two domains.
-- b) Strategy-wise reporting
--     This section lists the same information present in domain-wise
--     reporting in the way strategy is reported in other PA reports. This
--     provides easy correlation between information about static checks and
--     power intent.
--
-- Note: Presence of "--" in domain name field indicates that the
-- corresponding object doesn't belong to any specified power domain.
